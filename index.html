</<p><h3><marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left">welcome to my website here you will find a lot of fascinating information on Jellyfish</marquee><p><h2>Habitat:<h2> <p><h5> Jellyfish live in all the world's oceans and can withstand a wide range of temperatures and salinities. Most Jellyfish live in shallow coastal waters, but a few live in depths of up to 12,000 feet.<p><h2> Diet: <p><h5> Jellyfish are carnivores, so their diet mainly consists of other animals. This includes zoo-plankton, small crustaceans, small fish and other jellyfish. But Jellyfish will also consume plants,according to National Geographic. even though they aren't picky about what they eat, their diet typically depends on their size. Some jellyfish are as tiny as a pinhead, so they can only feed on things like plankton. Larger jellyfish prey on bigger food sources such as fish, shrimp, and crab.<p> <h2> FUN FACTS: <p> <h5> Jellyfish are 95% water. They don't have brains, hearts, or lungs. Jellyfish are a type of 'cnidarian'. Jellyfish have hydrostatic skeletons.They have very short lifespans, however there is a jellyfish that never dies called the immortal jellyfish. Jellyfish range from a few centimetres to over two metres in size. </p>
